# Amharic_OCR

The goal is to recognize text inside a scanned digital image. "ዐዲስ፡ያማርኛ፡መዝገበ፡ቃላት by (ደስታ፡ተክለ፡ወልድ።)" is the use case that we are employing. A total of 1285 pages were read, and a Python-tesseract was used to detect Amharic characters (ACR). In other words, it will recognize and "read" amharic text embedded in images.
